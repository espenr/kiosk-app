# Test Plan for Task 1.4: State Management Foundation

## Overview

This document outlines the testing approach for the state management foundation implemented in Task 1.4. The tests focus on verifying the functionality of widget registry, app settings, storage mechanisms, and data persistence.

## Test Categories

### 1. Widget Registry Tests

**Purpose**: Verify the widget type registration and instance management functionality.

| Test ID | Test Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| WR-01 | Register widget types | Widget types are successfully registered with metadata and default configs |
| WR-02 | Create widget instances | Widget instances are created with correct configurations based on type |
| WR-03 | Update widget instance | Widget instance properties can be updated, preserving the instance type |
| WR-04 | Delete widget instance | Widget instance is successfully removed from registry |
| WR-05 | Set widget capabilities | Widget capabilities are correctly associated with widget types |
| WR-06 | Get widgets by type | Correctly filters widgets by their type |

### 2. App Settings Tests

**Purpose**: Verify the application settings management functionality.

| Test ID | Test Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| AS-01 | Initialize default settings | Default settings are correctly created with appropriate structure |
| AS-02 | Update general settings | General settings section updates correctly |
| AS-03 | Update display settings | Display settings section updates correctly |
| AS-04 | Update network settings | Network settings section updates correctly |
| AS-05 | Update privacy settings | Privacy settings section updates correctly |
| AS-06 | Update advanced settings | Advanced settings section updates correctly |
| AS-07 | Reset settings | Settings are reset to default values |

### 3. Storage Tests

**Purpose**: Verify the storage mechanisms and data persistence.

| Test ID | Test Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| ST-01 | Save to localStorage | Data is correctly saved to localStorage with versioning |
| ST-02 | Load from localStorage | Data is correctly retrieved from localStorage |
| ST-03 | Save to IndexedDB | Larger data is correctly saved to IndexedDB |
| ST-04 | Load from IndexedDB | Data is correctly retrieved from IndexedDB |
| ST-05 | Storage migration | Data schema migrations work correctly between versions |
| ST-06 | Export app data | All configuration data is exported correctly |
| ST-07 | Import app data | Exported data is imported correctly |

### 4. Widget Data Tests

**Purpose**: Verify the widget-specific data management functionality.

| Test ID | Test Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| WD-01 | Save widget data | Widget-specific data is correctly saved |
| WD-02 | Load widget data | Widget-specific data is correctly retrieved |
| WD-03 | Update widget data | Widget data can be updated |
| WD-04 | Time to live (TTL) | Widget data with TTL expires and is removed when stale |
| WD-05 | Refresh widget data | Widget data can be refreshed from a data source |

### 5. Integration Tests

**Purpose**: Verify that all components work together correctly.

| Test ID | Test Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| IT-01 | Widget lifecycle | Complete widget lifecycle from creation to deletion works |
| IT-02 | State persistence | All state is correctly persisted across page reloads |
| IT-03 | Complete system | End-to-end verification of all state management components working together |

## Test Environment

- Browser: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge (latest versions)
- Local development environment
- No network connectivity required for most tests

## Testing Tools

1. **Browser Test Page**: `/tests/state-management-test.html`
   - Self-contained HTML test page to run all tests
   - Includes interactive buttons to run individual tests
   - Displays detailed logs and results

2. **Manual Browser Testing**:
   - Use the browser's developer tools to inspect localStorage and IndexedDB
   - Verify that data is being stored and retrieved correctly

## How to Run the Tests

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the test page in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/tests/state-management-test.html
   ```

3. Run the tests in the following order:
   - Widget Registry Tests
   - App Settings Tests
   - Storage Tests
   - Widget Data Tests
   - Integration Tests

4. For each test category, click the provided buttons to run individual tests
   - Green success messages indicate passed tests
   - Red failure messages indicate failed tests
   - Orange warning messages indicate potential issues

5. For each test, review the detailed logs in the output area

## Test Report

After running the tests, document the results in the following format:

| Test ID | Test Name | Status | Comments |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| WR-01 | Register widget types | | |
| WR-02 | Create widget instances | | |
| ... | ... | | |

Use the following status values:
- Pass: Test completed successfully
- Fail: Test did not produce the expected result
- N/A: Test could not be run

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail, check the following:

1. Browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Application tab in dev tools to view localStorage and IndexedDB content
3. Network tab for any unexpected network requests
4. Verify that the test code references the correct storage keys (matching the implementation)
