# Next Development Cycle - Task 1.4: State Management Foundation

## Overview

For our next development cycle, we'll focus on implementing Task 1.4: State Management Foundation. This task builds on the layout and theme systems we created in Task 1.3 and lays the groundwork for the application's state management.

## Objectives

According to our development plan, Task 1.4 includes:
- [ ] Set up React Context API structure
- [ ] Create configuration storage system
- [ ] Implement settings persistence

## Planned Approach

### 1. Context API Structure Enhancement

We already have started using React Context for layout and theme management. We'll expand this approach to create a more comprehensive state management system that will:

- Create a central context for application settings
- Implement a widget registry system
- Set up widget-specific context providers
- Create a global state hierarchy

### 2. Configuration Storage System

Building on our basic localStorage implementation:

- Create a more robust configuration system
- Implement versioning for configuration schema
- Add schema validation for configuration objects
- Create configuration grouping by feature/widget
- Add import/export functionality

### 3. Settings Persistence

Expand the persistence mechanisms:

- Investigate using IndexedDB for larger data sets
- Implement auto-save functionality
- Add data migration mechanisms for schema updates
- Create backup/restore functionality
- Add user profiles (optional)

## Technical Considerations

### State Management Architecture

We'll use a hybrid approach combining:
- React Context API for global state
- Prop drilling for component-specific state
- Individual widget state managed by their components

### Storage Strategy

- Use localStorage for basic settings and UI preferences
- Consider IndexedDB for larger datasets
- Implement proper error handling and fallbacks

### TypeScript Integration

- Define strong types for all state objects
- Create utility types for state operations
- Use discriminated unions for widget configuration

## Development Tasks Breakdown

1. **Widget Registry System** (2 days)
   - Create a WidgetRegistry context
   - Implement widget registration mechanism
   - Add widget metadata support

2. **Application Settings Context** (2 days)
   - Create main settings context
   - Implement settings structure
   - Add validation and default values

3. **Enhanced Storage System** (2 days)
   - Create a more robust storage mechanism
   - Add versioning support
   - Implement migration strategies

4. **Widget State Management** (2 days)
   - Create individual widget state structure
   - Implement position/size persistence
   - Add widget-specific settings

5. **Settings UI Enhancement** (2 days)
   - Upgrade the configuration panel
   - Add support for widget-specific settings
   - Implement settings search/filter

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test context providers in isolation
   - Verify state transitions
   - Test storage mechanisms

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test context interactions
   - Verify persistence between reloads
   - Test widget registration and configuration

3. **UI Tests**
   - Test settings UI components
   - Verify configuration panel functionality
   - Test widget configuration interactions

## Success Criteria

Task 1.4 will be considered complete when:

1. A comprehensive state management system is implemented
2. All configuration can be persisted between sessions
3. Widget-specific state can be managed
4. The settings UI supports all configuration options
5. Tests verify the functionality works correctly
6. Documentation is updated to reflect the new capabilities
