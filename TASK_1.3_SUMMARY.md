# Task 1.3: Core Layout System - Summary

## Completed Components

### 1. Grid-based Responsive Layout
- Created a Grid component that supports a configurable number of rows and columns
- Implemented GridItem component for placing widgets within the grid
- Added support for widget positioning with x, y, width, and height properties
- Integrated visibility control for widgets

### 2. Layout Configuration System
- Created LayoutContext to manage grid configuration and widget layouts
- Implemented layout configuration persistence using local storage
- Added support for updating widget positions and grid dimensions
- Built a configuration panel to demonstrate layout customization

### 3. Basic Theming Support
- Created ThemeContext to manage theme settings
- Implemented theme configuration persistence using local storage
- Added support for:
  - Light/Dark mode toggle
  - High contrast mode for accessibility
  - Configurable font sizes
  - Customizable primary and accent colors
- Built ThemeWrapper component that applies theme settings to the Chakra UI theme provider

## Architecture Overview

The layout system uses a context-based architecture with the following components:

1. **Context Providers**
   - LayoutProvider: Manages grid configuration and widget layouts
   - ThemeProvider: Manages theme settings and preferences

2. **Core Layout Components**
   - Grid: Container component that creates a CSS grid layout
   - GridItem: Widget container component positioned within the grid

3. **Configuration Components**
   - ConfigPanel: UI component for adjusting layout and theme settings

4. **Persistence Layer**
   - Storage utility for saving/loading configuration data to/from localStorage

## Next Steps

To further enhance the layout system:

1. Add drag-and-drop functionality for widget positioning
2. Implement widget resize handles
3. Create a widget library and registration system
4. Add more accessibility features
5. Implement responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes
